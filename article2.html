      <h2>The Expanding Universe</h2>
      The universe is expanding, so objects are moving farther away from each other over time. Moreover, this expansion is accelerating. This means that the speed at which a galaxy recedes from Earth increases with time. Therefore, galaxies are moving away from Earth faster and faster as time progresses.
      <p> </p>
      <strong>Definition:</strong> \( a \) is the distance between points in the universe, also known as the <em>comoving distance</em> or <em>scale factor</em>.
  
      <p>To understand the history of the universe, we must understand how the scale factor \( a \) evolves with time \( t \), i.e., \( a(t) \). The variation of the scale factor over time is determined by the energy density of the universe.</p>
  
      <p>When the universe was very young, radiation was the dominant component, and \( a \) was proportional to \( t^{1/2} \). Later, as non-relativistic matter became the most abundant form of energy density, \( a \) became proportional to \( t^{2/3} \).</p>
  
      After enough time goes by, the acceleration will leave every galaxy completely isolated in the Universe, as all the other structures accelerate irrevocably away.  So, there will be a point where our galaxy will be the only astrological thing we will be able to observe in the space. 
      <p> </p>
      Every time galaxies are being further away from the earth so our chances to find them are inevitablement worst each time in the future. I lose sleep wondering if there was a moment of our past where we were able to reach some amazing discovery but now is too late to find it.
