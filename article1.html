        <h2>We dont know what questions ask the universe</h2>
        To discover more about the universe, we first need to know what we’re looking for. Asking the right question often solves more than half the problem. We need to know what questions we're asking of the universe. For years, science has been asking: what was there at the beginning of the universe? But is this question rooted in a human conception, that because we experience life as having a beginning and an end, we try to project that same structure onto the universe? This makes me think that we imprint our own experience onto what we study. As finite beings, with a clear start and end, we naturally want to apply that same framework to everything, including the universe. But maybe that question only exists because of how we are built.
        It makes me reflect on how there are probably many questions we're not asking about the universe. The universe is out there, but we’re not asking the right things, because we're shaped by our own extremely narrow and particular reality.
        But then, how can we even begin to ask questions that we don’t yet know how to ask?
