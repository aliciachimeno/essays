      <p>Generative AI is transforming how scientists and engineers work. From writing code to drafting papers, it's now embedded in daily research tasks — but what happens when everyone uses the same model?</p>

      <p><strong>This short course explores a critical risk:</strong> the potential for intellectual homogenization. When every team turns to the same model for ideas or solutions, we risk converging on similar answers — diminishing the diversity, originality, and serendipity that science depends on.</p>

      <h3>What You'll Learn</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How AI-generated code and hypotheses may reinforce dominant assumptions</li>
        <li>What “convergence risk” means in computational science</li>
        <li>Best practices for using AI as an augmentation tool — not a replacement</li>
        <li>Ways to maintain creativity and epistemic diversity in research workflows</li>
      </ul>

      
      <h3>Who Should Attend?</h3>
      <p>This session is designed for CERN scientists, engineers, software developers, and anyone using AI tools in technical workflows.</p>

      <h3>Apply Critical Thinking to Generative AI</h3>
      <p>Don't just use the tools — understand them. In a time when productivity is accelerating, this course invites you to pause, reflect, and ask: Are we all thinking alike because the model told us to?</p>
